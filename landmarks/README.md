README for Assignment 2

The components for this assignment that were implemented utilizing the 2 APIs, using navigator.geolocation to find the coordinates of my current location and assigning it to a marker, and using Google Maps Simple Polyline function to draw a line between two coordinates. Functions for finding the distance between two coordinates, and an overall setMarker function was also implemented. A unique image was assigned to each type of marker by calling the general setMarker function three different times and passing in different coordinates, png files, and titles. The images used were a dumpling for my current location, pins for classmates, and houses for landmarks. 

I cited Ming's google_map's examples - found at: https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/tree/gh-pages/examples/google_maps - for the basis of setting up and understanding the project. The dumpling image was found at: http://thedumplinglife.blogspot.com/.The pin image was found at: http://www.clker.com/clipart-push-pin.html. The house image was found at: http://bnbnation.com/assects/property_tpyeimg/apartment.png. 

Something that could have been implemented better was organizing the content of the infoWindow for each marker, and formatted in a different way rather than string concatenation.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

The time I spent on this assignment was roughly 15.5 hrs.
