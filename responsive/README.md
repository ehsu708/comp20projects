README.md for Lab 4

The aspects that were implemented correctly were the media queries, and the changing image display with changes in browser width. The garfield.gif squares were implemented to display one at a time, following the specs of the assignment. While the code does seem repetitive, the function of the CSS file was appropriate.  

I did not discuss the lab with anyone. 

The lab took approximately 1 hr to finish.
