Lab 5

The aspects that were implemented correctly was the usage of .ontimeupdate function, as well as the accessing of currentTime. With each change in time, the lyrics were able to appear as annotations in the appropriate div id. 

Something that could have been implemented more concisely was the line breaks for each line within the stanzas. A use of a paragraph tag in the html to then style the inserted lyrics would have reduced the formatting within the script tag. 

I did not work on the lab with anyone. 

This lab took approximately 3.5 hours.
