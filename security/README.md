README for Assignment 4

Three security flaws were found in my partner's Assignment 2 and 3, involving mainly Cross Side Scripting vulnerabilities. The use of curl and blackbox testing was used and was able to produce results. I would like to try implementing actual security measures but my grasp on how to combat cross side scripting needs to develop further.

I did not collaborate with anyone for this assignment. 

This assignment took me approximately 3 hours.
