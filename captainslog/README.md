README.md for Lab 6

Elements of the lab that were implemented fully were the usage of timestamp() to find the date of entry and accessing the text input. While local storage was implemented, the sorting of local storage is not implemented entirely correctly - the first refresh in Safari has the local storage sorted correctly, but further additions and refreshes scramble the entries once again. 

I did not work with anyone on this lab.

I spent a total of 4 hours on the lab.
