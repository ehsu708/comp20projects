# README for Fall 2017 Web Programming Portfolio

The git repository serves as a collection of projects in web programming, working in a variety of languages (html, css, JS, node.js, etc.)

I enjoyed working on Assignment 3 the most - I didn't go into the assignment thinking I would enjoy working with servers and databases, but I found mongodb and node.js interesting to learn and the usage of it was logically digestable. It was gratifying to see our map work and take in the checkins appropriately, and the assignment gave me a better sense of just how a web server handles requests and responses.

I think I've grown just in the breadth of my knowledge about web programming - the foundations will allow me to feel more comfortable exploring front-end design and understanding the limitations of web design. Having started from knowing pretty much nothing about web programming, it's been good to get a handle on knowing how to use API's, learning different frameworks, and understanding the basics (and importance) of security.

The most important thing I've learned in this class is attention to detail. Working on Assignment 4 and looking for security flaws showed me how important it is to think of all aspects of a web app, in order to prevent issues - it's not good enough to just have a working site if it's vulnerable. Also, as I worked on assignments throughout, there have been many small details that slipped through the cracks the first time around (see: /checkins vs /checkins.json); while having a big picture of the assignments have helped me understand them logically, I've learned that it's also important to look at the small items in order to get the big assignment to work (see: the details of syntax when using curl).

Being an engineering psychology major and having an interest in design, I'd like to delve deeper into reactive frameworks for front-end development. Learning more CSS frameworks and their capabilities is also something I'm interested in further pursuing.
